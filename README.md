# Bee Inkspired 

Bee Inkspired is the homepage for Olivia Harpers tattoo business, it showcases her work and allows her and her customers a place to manage appointment bookings and deal with enquires. The website is themed around her brand and logo.

## Features

As a B2C site the final aim is to impress customers to book a tattoo or make an enquiry. The site needs to be easy to navigate and comprehensive in the information given on Olivia, her skills and the studio. The booking system needs to be straight forward and simple.

#### Goals for the user

- Learn about the artist and view previous work
- Easy to locate the studio 
- Simple link to artists social media
- Register and log in with authentication
- View a personalised dashboard to see user details and upcoming bookings
- Send an enquiry with a reference image


#### Goals for the Artist

- Separate dashboard to show upcoming bookings and enquiries


## Future features

- Users will need to pay a deposit to secure their booking.
- Times slots added to bookings so there can be multiple flash tattoos in a day if the artist has no other tattoos scheduled for that day.
- Users dashboards will have status updates for any enquiries they send
- Time limit for when users can update their booking



## Bugs

The form to create a booking is made with a custom date field to only display the upcoming 2 weeks, therefore this data then had to be modified and saved onto the booking model.
