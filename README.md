## User Experience (UX)

The user target market is adults who are interested in a new tattoo either for a flash design or they want to contact an artist to discuss a design they have in mind. 

### User Stories
 
GitHub issues custom template feature is used to display the User Stories that was used for building this site.

Only One user story was scoped and labelled 'Won't Have'. It was for customers to pay a deposit before their booking is secure, this is not currently a feature on the site.

#### Goals for the user

- Learn about the artist and view previous work
- Easy to locate the studio 
- Simple link to artists' social media
- Register and log in with authentication
- View a personalised dashboard to see user details and upcoming bookings
- Send an enquiry with a reference image


#### Goals for the Artist

- Separate dashboard to show upcoming bookings and enquiries

### Design 

The theme is consistant through the site, mainly tailored around being dark and Gothic much like her studio. 
The yellow font (#cfb442) was chosen using a colour picker on her logo to ensure the website represents her brand exactly.
The font was chosen to compliment her logo rather than match it, as the font needed to be bolder to stand out against the dark background. The chosen font is Bricolage Grotesque imported via Google Fonts with a back up of Sans Sarif.

#### Wireframes

![Wireframe screenshot](static/assets/images/wireframes.jpeg)

The website has stuck to its origninal wireframe design, but more pages had to be added than what was in the scope. The addition pages were form pages such as the enquiry form and customer review page which follow the login page wireframe.

## Features

As a B2C site the final aim is to impress customers to book a tattoo or make an enquiry. The site needs to be easy to navigate and comprehensive in the information given on Olivia, her skills and the studio. The booking system needs to be straight forward and simple.

Current features fufill all the user goals for the website as well as an additional feature allowing customers to leave a review for a previous booking on their dash that will then be automatically displayed on the homepage.

### Future features

- Users will need to pay a deposit to secure their booking.
- Times slots added to bookings so there can be multiple flash tattoos in a day if the artist has no other tattoos scheduled for that day.
- Users dashboards will have status updates for any enquiries they send
- Time limit for when users can update their booking
- Admin can approve reviews before they get displayed on the homepage incase they are unprofessional, eg contain foul language.


## Agile Methodology

After using GitHub's issues to create my User Stories, these where then put onto the projects GitHub project board, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/debbie-herridge/projects/11/views/1). An addition colomn was added for 'current iteration' to display which Epics where being worked on in the current Milestone.

## Data

The diagram below shows the data schema and shows the database models relationships with each other.
![Diagram for database](/static/assets/images/data-schema.jpeg)

## Security features

### User Authentication

There are custom decorators used to ensure the webpage is only access if permission is given.

1. Unauthenticated user - this decorator checks if a user is logged in and if are they will not be able to see the login or register page.
2. Allowed users - this decorator will stop admin seeing the customers dashboard, and customers seeing the admin dashboard.

### Database 

The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

## Testing

### Testing MVC Framework

The MVC framework is present in both the customer and artist dashboard where the view is fetching data from the model and displaying them. When customers update their profile details or their booking these changes are then sent to the controller which will then update the view accordingly.

### Code

#### HTML Testing

HTML was tested using [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-debbieherri-beeinkspire-roezq58cv31.ws-eu107.gitpod.io%2F). It passed with two warnings, but as these are headings top-level headings for subjects they are not a concern.

#### CSS Testing 

The CSS was tested using [W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) and passed.

#### Pylint

[![linting: pylint](https://img.shields.io/badge/linting-pylint-yellowgreen)](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint)

Python code was tested using Pylint, which was installed in the terminal using **pip install pylint** and ran using the command **pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')**. 

The python code was rated 5.98 out of 10, after an inital rating of 5.53. Improvements were made by removing any trailing whitespaces and adding final new lines. The majority of the errors were due to lines being too long in migrations and using wildcard imports for models and forms.

#### Javascript

***** Fix Java map and rerun test ******

### User Experience

Testing user experience was done extensively. This involved testing links from different pages and making sure it was unnecessary for a user to have to scroll far or struggle to find their way back to the previous page. 

Several people where asked to make accounts, add bookings and enquiries, and amend their booking and profile. The only critative feedback that was given that the errors given for the registration were not easy to read, therefore a custom error message was added which is more reader friendly to the user. Many people commented that they liked the image container for the forms and dashboard were consistant as with the font and styling.

User stories where crucial to this testing to ensure that user experience using the website was seemless and easy to navigate.

Lighthouse on Google Dev tools was used to test the load time for the site, it received a score of 84.

## Bugs

The DateField in the booking model caused many bugs and needed plenty of troubleshooting. As the form to create a booking is made with a custom date field to only display the upcoming 2 weeks, this was not included in the form using the Django form template. Therefore this data then had to be modified from strftime, which makes the date more user friendly, back into strptime to be saved onto the booking model.

To solve the issue [this article](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior) from Python.org was extremely helpful in solving the issue.

A bug following on from the above was iterating through the list of dates and removing the booked dates so that users could not select those from the custom date field in the booking form. [This article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-remove-all-values-from-a-list-present-in-other-list/) from GeeksForGeeks helped understand how to iterate through one list and remove any matching data in another list.


## Creating the website

The project was created on Gitpod and pushed to GitHub, the Data is stored with ElephantSQL and media is stored in Cloudinary, both linked with API's to the project. The website is then deployed to create the app using Heroku.
