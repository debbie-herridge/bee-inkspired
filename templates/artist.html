                <p>My name is Olivia Harper. I am a tattoo artist based in Wisbech. My tattoo journey began in October 2019, 
                    I was an apprentice for a few months. Circumstances changed and I had to stop unfortunately. For a couple years, 
                    I had lost hope in ever achieving my dream to be a tattooist. Then at the start of 2022, I found the determination to try again. 
                    Then in September 2022, I open my studio door and began my very own business. I am now the proud owner of BeeInkspired Tattoo, 
                    I mainly special in black and grey realism.</p>
